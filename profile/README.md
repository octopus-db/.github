This is the shared GitHub code and documentation repository of the <strong>OCTOPUS Database</strong> project.

OCTOPUS is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database for visualizing, querying, and downloading cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al, luminescence, radiocarbon ages and denudation rates related to erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms, and paleoecological, paleoenvironmental, and archaeological records. It also includes ancillary geospatial data layers.

The database follows the FAIR data principles and is based on open-source software deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Data stored in the database can be visualised, queried, and downloaded via a custom-built web interface and via desktop GIS applications that support OGC data access protocols.
