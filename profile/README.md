This is the shared GitHub code and documentation repository of the <strong>OCTOPUS Database</strong> project.

OCTOPUS is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database that allows users to visualise, query, and download cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be and <sup>26</sup>Al, luminescence, and radiocarbon ages and denudation rates associated with erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms and archaeological records, along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

The database follows the FAIR data principles and is based on open-source software deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Data stored in the database can be visualised, queried, and downloaded via a custom-built web interface and via desktop GIS applications that support OGC data access protocols.
